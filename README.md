Imagine this code is a digital cat album. This album is not just an ordinary one, it's interactive and you can search for your favorite cats in it.

When you open the album (which is what the App is), the first thing it does is to ask for a list of cats from an online source (the fetch function does this). It's like asking someone to hand over pictures of cats so it can put them in the album.

Once it has the list of cats, it stores them, alongside with a 'search field' which is like a search box for you to type the name of the cat you're looking for.

There is a function (the onSearchChange function) that listens for what you're typing in this search box. As you type, it updates the search box with your input.

When the album is ready to show you the cats (the render function), it takes the list of cats and the text you've typed in the search box. If you've typed something, it filters the cats to only show those whose names include what you've typed. It's like the album magically rearranging itself to show only the cats you're interested in.

Finally, it displays the title "Beautiful cats", a search box for you to type in, and the list of cats that match your search. It's like flipping open the album to see the photos and the search box.
